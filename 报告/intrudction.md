### Introduction to Project 2: SmartRecipe

In today’s fast-paced world, healthy eating and meal preparation can sometimes be a challenge, especially for those with busy lifestyles. **SmartRecipe** is an innovative app designed to solve this problem by using cutting-edge image recognition technology to identify ingredients directly from user-uploaded photos. This app goes beyond just identifying food—it helps users make smarter cooking choices by suggesting personalized recipes based on the available ingredients and providing detailed nutritional insights. 

The core idea behind **SmartRecipe** is to make meal preparation easier, reduce food waste, and empower users to make healthier, more informed decisions about what they eat. Whether you are an experienced cook or a beginner, SmartRecipe offers a seamless and intelligent way to plan meals, ensuring that you can create delicious and nutritious dishes with the ingredients you already have at hand.

### Objectives of SmartRecipe

The **SmartRecipe** project is composed of three major components, each of which contributes to creating a personalized and holistic cooking experience:

1. **Food Ingredient Identification:**
   The first task is to train a **multi-label image classification model** that can accurately identify the multiple ingredients present in a given image. This system should be able to detect various food items from a user’s photo, even if the image contains multiple ingredients. The reference datasets for this task are **MAFood121** and **FoodSeg103**, which contain labeled food images that will be used to train the model. The goal is to allow the app to recognize and label food items with high accuracy, making it an essential foundation for the recipe recommendation and nutritional analysis systems.

2. **Recipe Recommendation System:**
   Once the ingredients are identified, the next step is to generate personalized **recipe recommendations**. This system is built using a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, fine-tuned to analyze the identified ingredients and suggest multiple feasible recipes. These recipes will not only provide ingredient quantities but also detailed step-by-step instructions for preparation. The recipe recommendations are generated based on the input ingredients and their compatibility, ensuring that users can create a dish that is both delicious and practical. The **Food Recipe** dataset will serve as a reference for fine-tuning the LLM.

3. **Nutrient Analysis System:**
   To enhance the app’s usefulness, the **Nutrient Analysis System** is integrated into the recipe recommendation. By examining the variety of ingredients in the recipe, the system associates each ingredient’s nutritional content (calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) with the recipe as a whole. This will allow users to understand the nutritional profile of their dish and make informed decisions based on their dietary goals. The **Open Food Facts Product Database** serves as the reference dataset for this component.
