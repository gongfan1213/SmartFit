It looks like you need help adjusting some sections of your project description, especially regarding the custom-trained models you worked with. I'll provide a revised version of the part where you explain the image recognition and the involvement of your custom-trained models, removing any references to pre-trained models if needed.

Hereâ€™s a proposed adjustment for the section that might need to reflect your custom-trained models:

### Image Recognition

In this project, we employed a custom-trained model for image recognition tasks. This model was specifically trained on a curated dataset of food images, which includes ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, and meats. Unlike using pre-trained models, this approach allowed us to create a tailored model capable of accurately identifying and classifying multiple ingredients from food images based on their pixel-wise annotations.

The training process involved preprocessing the FoodSeg103 dataset, which contains 103 food categories with pixel-wise annotations. We used a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform multi-label classification, where each food image was classified into one or more ingredient categories. This model was trained with a set of images representing various foods and their ingredients, with a focus on ingredient-level segmentation.

Once trained, the model was used to predict ingredients in new food images. By passing an input image through the trained model, the system provides the predicted ingredients with corresponding segmentation masks. These predictions are then used for further tasks, such as recipe recommendations and nutritional analysis.
