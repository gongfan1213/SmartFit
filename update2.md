Based on your training logs and model configuration, there are a few issues that could be contributing to the poor performance of your model (such as `micro_f1` being 0, `accuracy` being 0, and `hamming_loss` being 1). Here are some key things to check and suggestions to fix the problem:

### 1. **Label Encoding Issue**
   The model is likely failing to correctly predict the classes because the labels might not be encoded properly.

   **Possible Issue**: You are using `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, which expects each output to be a probability (between 0 and 1) for each class. The target labels need to be in binary format (0 or 1 for each class). 
   
   **Fix**: Ensure that the target tensor you pass to the loss function is a binary vector (with values 0 or 1) for each image. It looks like you're already doing this in your dataset class, but it’s important to verify that the labels for each class are being set correctly and match the format expected by the loss function.

   - Check the shape of your target tensor (`target`), which should be `[batch_size, num_classes]` with binary values for each class.

### 2. **Model Output and Activation**
   The model uses CLIP (with a visual encoder) and adds a custom classifier. The output from the model is passed to the `BCEWithLogitsLoss` function, which expects raw logits (not probabilities). Ensure that:

   - The model outputs raw logits (no `sigmoid` activation inside the model, as `BCEWithLogitsLoss` applies `sigmoid` internally).
   - The target labels are in binary format as expected by `BCEWithLogitsLoss`.

   **Fix**: Ensure that the final output layer of your model is a linear layer with no `sigmoid` activation, as the loss function applies it automatically.

### 3. **Class Imbalance**
   Your dataset might have an imbalance in the class distribution, which could be causing issues during training. You've calculated class weights, but you should also check if the weights are correctly applied in the loss function. 

   **Fix**: Double-check that the `pos_weight` parameter in `BCEWithLogitsLoss` is being set correctly.

   Example:
   ```python
   class_weights = calculate_class_weights(train_loader).to(device)
   criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=class_weights)
   ```

### 4. **Learning Rate**
   The learning rate might be too high or too low, which can prevent the model from converging.

   **Fix**: You are using a learning rate scheduler (`CosineAnnealingLR`), but you may want to experiment with a smaller initial learning rate. Try reducing the learning rate to see if it helps the model learn better.

   Example:
   ```python
   optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5, weight_decay=0.05)
   ```

### 5. **Model Overfitting / Underfitting**
   If the training loss is significantly lower than the validation loss, it could indicate overfitting, especially with such a small number of epochs (5 epochs). However, if both are similarly bad, it might suggest underfitting.

   **Fix**: 
   - Try increasing the number of epochs and monitor the loss and metrics.
   - If the model is overfitting, try adding regularization like dropout or increasing data augmentation.
   - If it’s underfitting, consider experimenting with a more powerful model architecture or fine-tuning the CLIP model.

### 6. **Early Stopping**
   Early stopping is triggered because validation metrics didn't improve, but the issue may be that the model has not had enough time to learn.

   **Fix**: Disable early stopping temporarily and train for more epochs to see if the model performance starts to improve after more training time.

### 7. **Check Training Data**
   Ensure that the images are loaded correctly and that their corresponding labels match. If there's a mismatch between images and labels, the model won't learn the correct mapping.

### Conclusion:
Here's a step-by-step checklist of what to try:

1. **Check label encoding**: Ensure that target labels are binary and match the expected format for multi-label classification.
2. **Model output**: Make sure the output of the model is raw logits and not passed through a `sigmoid` activation, since `BCEWithLogitsLoss` handles that.
3. **Adjust learning rate**: Try lowering the learning rate (e.g., try `1e-5` or `1e-4`).
4. **Check class imbalance**: Verify that class weights are correctly applied to the loss function.
5. **Disable early stopping**: Temporarily turn off early stopping and train for more epochs to allow the model to learn.
6. **Check data loading**: Verify that data loading is correct, and the labels match the images.

By adjusting these areas and retraining, you should be able to improve the model’s performance. Let me know if you need further assistance on any specific step!
